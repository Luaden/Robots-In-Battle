  randomFightDialogue:
  - I'm literally going to recycle your mech for drinking money later.
  - Where did you get that mech? The toilet... store?
  - Look, I'm only here because GGC is coming up soon, so go easy on me, alright?
  - I'd ask you to follow me on Twitter, but after that display, I'm already concerned
    enough about your mental health.
  - Hahaha, oh my god. I thought the punch button was the kick button this whole
    time. How crazy is that?
  - If you could just eject and let me pound your mech a bit, that would really help
    me out.
  - That belt belongs to me! Well, I mean, not yet, but it will after I kick your
    ass.
