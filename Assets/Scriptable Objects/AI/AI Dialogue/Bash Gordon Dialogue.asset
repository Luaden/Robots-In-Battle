  introDialogue:
  - "One and two and three and jump! Four and five and six and pump! Jazzercise isn\u2019t
    just a way of exercising, it\u2019s a way of living! Only for you, it\u2019s
    about to be a way of dying! Let\u2019s go!"
  - "That\u2019s right, it\u2019s me, the one and only Bash Gordon! Voted RnB\u2019s
    most eligible bachelor for six years running, owner of the highest sex appeal
    and lowest neckline in the galaxy and soon to be the pilot that defeated you!"
  - "Thank you, thank you, I love this crowd! I\u2019m so happy to be here tonight
    for another chapter in my RnB journey, though considering my opponent, I think
    it\u2019s going to be a short one!"
  introResponseDialogue:
  - "This level of energy makes me very uncomfortable. Let\u2019s just get to the
    battle."
  - Your belt is mine, you glorified gym teacher.
  - "When we\u2019re done, I\u2019m going to buy the rights to your image and make
    you get a makeover."
  aIWinDialogue:
  - "And that\u2019s how it\u2019s done! Another day, another flawless title defence.
    Don\u2019t feel too bad, you\u2019re just another in a long line of challengers
    who didn\u2019t have the moves to step to me."
  aILoseDialogue:
  - "What!? How did you manage that? My jazzercise technique was flawless, my hair
    was immaculate, how could you have beaten me!? You don\u2019t even wear a leotard!"
  randomFightDialogue:
  - "I\u2019ve always lived my life by what my mother told me; It\u2019s all in the
    hips and the lips and the eyes and the thighs. That advice has made me a champion."
  - One, two, three, pump! Feel the burn in your pelvis! One, two, three, thrust!
    Feel the power in your glutes! This is jazzercise!
  - "Have you got what it takes to survive my ab-blaster workout? It\u2019s 24 hours
    straight of jazzercise and if you break down, you have to pay double!"
