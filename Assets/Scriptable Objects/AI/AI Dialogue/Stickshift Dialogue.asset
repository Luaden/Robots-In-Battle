  introDialogue:
  - So ya finally made it out here. Is... that yer mech? Oh boy, I guess we've got
    a long way to go here.
  introResponseDialogue: []
  aIWinDialogue:
  - Wow, bud, yer just more useless than spare parts on a new mech aren't ya?
  aILoseDialogue:
  - Nicely done! Now let's get yer mech patched up and ready for the competition.
    *There's 1000:1 odds on ya and I went all in, so don't let me down or I'm gonna
    have to close the shop.
  randomFightDialogue:
  - Alright, first things first. See those computer chips, at the bottom of yer HUD?
    Those are yer mech's abilities. *They all have different uses, but those are
    how yer gonna win fights. *Ya can use one red attack and one green defense per
    round, but yer blue neutral cards can be played in either slot. *So try draggin'
    a red and a green card into the middle channel, the teal one.
  - Alright. So this time, check out the top of yer HUD. See the red and blue bars?
    Those are the health and energy of our mechs. *Ya lose with 0 health and energy
    is spent on cards, so ya gain a bit every round. *You'll be able to see how much
    energy yer opponent is gonna use before each round. Use that to predict how they'll
    play!
  - Alright, next lesson. When ye're selecting a card, you can see what channels
    it can target in. You'll also see a readout of my mech's components. *Ya can
    also see all of the components by clicking our portraits at the top of your HUD.
    *Dealing damage in a channel does damage to components, and if ya can do enough
    to break it, all yer damage in that channel is increased!
  - Alright, last lesson. Ya mighta noticed some of these shields popping up over
    the channels between us. Those are shields that block incoming damage. *Abilities
    that guard will lower damage first and generate some shield as well. If ya can
    predict an attack and guard it, you'll come out on top!
