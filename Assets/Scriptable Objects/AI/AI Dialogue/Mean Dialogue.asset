  introDialogue:
  - I just want you to know that I'm going to use the winnings from this fight to
    take your mom out for a lovely evening on the town.
  - "Remember, winners don\u2019t do drugs. That\u2019s why I suggest you go do some
    in order to cope with your upcoming loss."
  - "I\u2019m going to beat you so bad that even your mecha\u2019s momma won\u2019t
    recognise it."
  - "If pilots were animals then you\u2019d be a Dodo because I\u2019m about to make
    you extinct. Also because it sounds like doodoo."
  introResponseDialogue:
  - "That\u2019s a lot of big words for a glorified punching bag."
  - "Keep talking, it\u2019ll hurt even more when I make you eat your words."
  - "Winners don\u2019t have to talk so much to prove themselves. They just win."
  - "I\u2019m getting tired of seeing your mouth move. How about you watch my fists
    move instead?"
  aIWinDialogue:
  - "Ah, the sweet smell of success. Don\u2019t give up your day job just yet nerd,
    you aren\u2019t good enough for the big leagues."
  aILoseDialogue:
  - "Don\u2019t talk to me or my mechanical son ever again."
  randomFightDialogue:
  - I am literally going to recycle your mech for drinking money later.
  - Where did you get that mech? The toilet... store?
  - "If you scratch the paint job then I\u2019m going to scratch your retinas\u2026
    from behind."
  - I'd ask you to follow me on Twitter, but after that display, I'm already concerned
    enough about your mental health.
  - Hahaha, oh my god. I thought the punch button was the kick button this whole
    time. How crazy is that?
  - If you could just eject and let me pound your mech a bit, that would really help
    me out.
