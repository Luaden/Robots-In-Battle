  introDialogue: I just want you to know that I'm going to use the winnings from
    this fight to take your mom out for a lovely evening on the town.
  aIWinDialogue: "Ah, the sweet smell of success. Anyhow, can\u2019t wait around
    here, I\u2019ve got big plans for tonight. Don\u2019t wait up sport!"
  aILoseDialogue: "Don\u2019t talk to me or my mechanical son ever again."
  randomFightDialogue:
  - I am literally going to recycle your mech for drinking money later.
  - Where did you get that mech? The toilet... store?
  - "If you scratch the paint job then I\u2019m going to scratch your retinas\u2026
    from the inside."
  - I'd ask you to follow me on Twitter, but after that display, I'm already concerned
    enough about your mental health.
  - Hahaha, oh my god. I thought the punch button was the kick button this whole
    time. How crazy is that?
  - If you could just eject and let me pound your mech a bit, that would really help
    me out.
