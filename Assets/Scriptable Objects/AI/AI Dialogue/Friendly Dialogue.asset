  introDialogue: Hey, how's it going? I just wanna wish you good luck before we,
    like, cross mechas. This is going to be a wicked cool fight so may the best mecha,
    like, win!
  aIWinDialogue: Alright! That was absolutely radical! Thank you for the great fight
    and I hope I see you out here again some time. Hang loose dude!
  aILoseDialogue: "That was gnarly but you are most triumphant my dude. Thank you
    for the opportunity to fight such a magnificent future champion.\r"
  randomFightDialogue:
  - "Tubular work my dude! If my defences weren\u2019t so bodacious, you would already
    have beaten me!"
  - "Do you mind waving to the Wyld Stallyns out in the stands? That\u2019s my band
    and they all came here to support me!"
  - Maybe after the fight we can go for some fries together? No? All groovy, no offence
    meant or taken.
  - "Like, my dude, I\u2019m wigging out over this fight. Like, if I lose, what happens
    to me? Where do I go?"
  - "Radical, you\u2019re killing it today! If it wasn\u2019t my ass that you\u2019re
    kicking, I\u2019d be cheering you on."
  - "This is totally random but what do you think of that mechanic guy? I really
    like him\u2026 Do you think he\u2019s single?"
