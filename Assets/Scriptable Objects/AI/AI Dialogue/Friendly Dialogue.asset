  introDialogue:
  - "Hey, how's it going? I just wanna wish you good luck before we, like, cross
    mechas. Hang loose and we\u2019ll have a sick time.\r"
  - "This is going to be a wicked cool fight so may the best mecha, like, win!\r"
  - "I am so psyched to battle you! It\u2019s going to be a real blast and no matter
    who wins, I know we\u2019ll give it our all!"
  - "Dude, if I win I\u2019m going to donate my winnings to charity. What are you
    going to do with yours?"
  - "Dude, if I win I\u2019m going to donate my winnings to charity. What are you
    going to do with yours?"
  introResponseDialogue:
  - "You\u2019re so nice that it\u2019s almost going to hurt me to destroy you. Almost."
  - "Don\u2019t think I\u2019m fooled by your chill mannerisms, I\u2019m still going
    to wreck you."
  - All this talking, not enough battling. After all, time is money.
  - "If all pilots were as nice as you, I\u2019d already be the champion."
  aIWinDialogue:
  - "Alright! That was absolutely radical! Thank you for the great fight and I hope
    I see you out here again some time, if you can fiscally ever recover from this
    I mean. Anyhow, hang loose dude!\r"
  aILoseDialogue:
  - That was gnarly but you are most triumphant my dude. Thank you for the opportunity
    to battle such a magnificent future champion.
  randomFightDialogue:
  - "Tubular work my dude! If my defences weren\u2019t so bodacious, you would already
    have beaten me!"
  - "Do you mind waving to the Wyld Stallyns out in the stands? That\u2019s my band
    and they all came here to support me!"
  - Maybe after the fight we can go for some fries together? No? All groovy, no offence
    meant or taken.
  - "Like, my dude, I\u2019m wigging out over this fight. Like, if I lose, what happens
    to me? Where do I go?"
  - "Radical, you\u2019re killing it today! If it wasn\u2019t my ass that you\u2019re
    kicking, I\u2019d be cheering you on."
  - "This is totally random but what do you think of that mechanic guy? I really
    like him\u2026 Do you think he\u2019s single?"
